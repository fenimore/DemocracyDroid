## Democracy Droid!

This is a [Democracy Now!](http://democracynow.org) Android app which 
streams and manages downloads for the video and audio broadcast of Democracy Now! 
It also streams the live-stream (at 8am Eastern) and acts as a transcript 
reader for individual stories and headlines. It is a fully featured app :).
